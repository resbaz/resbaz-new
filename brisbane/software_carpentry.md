## Day 1 & 2: Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, and the advanced stream

Over the first two days of the event, two Software Carpentry and one Data Carpentry workshops will run simultaneously. These hands-on workshops will cover basic computer programming concepts and tools for researchers, including program design, version control, data management, and task automation. Participants can elect to participate in either the Python stream or R stream.

The Data Carpentry workshop will focus on genomics and bioinformatics tools on the command line.

Simultaneously there will be an advanced stream for those who already have experience with programming or have participated in a Software Carpentry workshop before.

At the end of day 1 and day 2 keynote speakers will inform attendants about the importance of data in the 21st century and how they got to where they are.
